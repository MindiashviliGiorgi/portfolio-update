            I used a form divided into several components, which were connected to each other through LocalStorage.
            I sent the final result as a complete ticket to Firebase, and from there, users could obtain a specific 
            ticket using a unique reference number, allowing them to cancel or delete the ticket. Also you can convert
            final ticket as a PDF file for save information. The website 
            is full responsive.
